# OS-Pluggable-Security-Modules

Created 2019 for OS class

This project shows a simulated an OS environment with PAMs(Pluggable Access Modules) to show different security protocols for access of files as well as read/write permissions.

There are 3 included PAMs for simple password based user authentication, 2 factor authentication, and password based with Hashing. These are created to be easily interchangable to allow new security features to be developed sepately.

Note- Each PAM includes their own set of profiles to be consistent with their protocols
